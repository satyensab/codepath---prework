## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
W3Schools - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-an-array-with-random-values-with-the-help-of-javascript/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

Throughout this whole pre-work assignment my main challenge was actually figuring out how to understand the basics of Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Because I came from a background and skills in python and data science, shifting my brain to understand new programming languages and basics of web development proved difficult. The first problem that I encountered was the syntax of html and how it was so different from the traditional way I see programming.Looking through the pre-work tutorial I actually wanted to understand every little detail that was going on to make this game. All these concepts that were being thrown got me confused on what syntax and for which language they were being used for. The behavior of javascript talking to another language through DOM was unfamiliar to me and understanding what was actually happening proved difficult at first. To combat my inability to understand I actually spent time reading up on external sources of the basics of javascript, html, and css and went to thoroughly its syntax and what it is used for. I wrote my own code separate from the project and practiced each language's functionality and what it was used for. I then went back to the pre-work tutorial,read through each line carefully, and then without looking at the given code wrote my own code and then compared the two. After repeating that process for each step I finally started to understand at least the basics of the three languages.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

 Now that I have dipped my toes into web development and how it works I would like to know what is the extent of web development. When you are a web developer do you mainly work on building websites or is there more to that? Or do web developers have the knowledge to build different types of interfaces besides just websites. User interfaces such as virtual reality,gps interface, etc.I mainly wanted to enter in this program to expand my knowledge on coding and get better. As a data science student will it be helpful to have some knowledge of web development? Would knowing some web development help me work with web developers better.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

 I would like to play with the audio and images of the different buttons. As the optional features suggested I would have liked to play different types of sounds when a button was clicked. Another feature that I would add would be to display the current score of the user, which shows how many patterns the user got correctly. As the program is right now the user does not know how many patterns they have got correctly. Implementing a score counter would be helpful for when the user is playing the game. A timer is another feature that I would have added to make the game a little bit harder. I would create a variable that would handle how long the timer should be and once that timer hits zero if the user has not picked a button then they would lose. The timer function would add a whole nother aspect to the game by making the user pressured by the clock.
